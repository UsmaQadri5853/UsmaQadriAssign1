## Project

The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate understanding of GitHub (ex: cloning/editing/pulling/merging/committing/pushing code). It also demonstrates basic java principles. 

The project has two java files. 

Card.java is a class that models playing card Objects.  

CardTrick.java is a class that picks 7 random cards to form a hand, and then asks the user to select a random card. It will search an array to locate the user's card.
